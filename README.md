Started from desktop version first.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I practiced what I know before. I learned that I can use <br> in media queries or remove it where I don't need it. It's better than giving width to some sub text.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
